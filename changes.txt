BBCP HOSTNAME RESOLUTION FIXES
===============================
Date: June 8, 2025
Author: Mario Jauvin (marioja)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
===================
BBCP was failing with hostname resolution errors when used in Docker containers,
specifically when trying to resolve "localhost" or other network addresses. This
caused connection failures during file transfers in containerized environments.

CHANGES MADE:
=============

ENHANCED HOSTNAME RESOLUTION IN bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C
--------------------------------------------------
File: src/bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C
Method: bbcp_NetAddrInfo::Set()

Improvements:
- Added robust error handling for getaddrinfo() failures
- Implemented fallback mechanism using gethostbyname() when getaddrinfo() fails
- Added debug logging to track hostname resolution attempts
- Ensured proper cleanup of allocated memory structures
- Enhanced support for both numeric IP addresses and hostname resolution
- Improved IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack compatibility

Technical Details:
- Added proper error checking after getaddrinfo() calls
- Implemented gethostbyname() fallback for legacy hostname resolution
- Added debug output with bb_Debug.Say() for troubleshooting
- Ensured freeaddrinfo() is called to prevent memory leaks
- Enhanced error reporting with specific failure reasons

FILE SPECIFICATION DECODE FIX IN bbcp_FileSpec.C
------------------------------------------------
File: src/bbcp_FileSpec.C
Method: bbcp_FileSpec::Decode()

Problem:
- Original bbcp required exactly 9 fields in file specifications
- Docker containers sometimes send incomplete file specifications with only 8 fields
- This caused "Unable to decode item 9 in file specification" errors

Solution:
- Modified the decode logic to accept both 8 and 9 fields for Docker container compatibility
- Added condition: if (n != 9 && n != 8) to allow both field counts
- Added handling for missing filename field: if (n == 8) { strcpy(fnbuff, ""); }
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing 9-field specifications

Technical Details:
- Changed validation from requiring exactly 9 fields to accepting 8 or 9 fields
- Added empty filename handling for directory entries with missing filename field
- Preserves all existing functionality while improving Docker container compatibility

VERSION NUMBER UPDATE IN bbcp_Version.C
---------------------------------------
File: src/bbcp_Version.C
Variable: Version

Change:
- Updated version string from "Version: 17.12.00.00.0" to "Version: 17.12.00.00.1"
- Incremented the patch version number to indicate the Docker container fixes
- Maintains version format compatibility with existing bbcp installations

Purpose:
- Identifies builds that include the Docker container compatibility fixes
- Allows administrators to verify they have the patched version
- Follows semantic versioning convention for patch-level changes

TESTING PERFORMED:
==================
Hostname Resolution (bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C):
- Verified bbcp binary compilation and execution
- Tested hostname resolution with localhost, 127.0.0.1, and [::1] IPv6
- Confirmed proper error handling for invalid hostnames
- Validated that network connection attempts occur after successful hostname resolution
- Verified debug output shows successful address resolution in verbose mode

File Specification Decode (bbcp_FileSpec.C):
- Tested with both 8-field and 9-field file specifications
- Verified directory handling with missing filename fields
- Confirmed backward compatibility with existing file specifications
- Validated proper error handling for invalid field counts

Version Identification (bbcp_Version.C):
- Confirmed version number displays as "17.12.00.00.1" in --version output
- Verified version checking works properly with updated version string
- Tested version compatibility warnings with different bbcp versions

IMPACT:
=======
Hostname Resolution Improvements:
- Fixes hostname resolution failures in various network environments
- Improves reliability of bbcp network connectivity
- Enables bbcp to work properly with localhost and modern networking configurations

File Specification Handling:
- Resolves "Unable to decode item 9" errors in Docker containers
- Improves compatibility with containerized file transfer scenarios
- Ensures reliable operation when file specifications have missing fields

Version Tracking:
- Provides clear identification of patched vs. unpatched bbcp installations
- Enables administrators to verify deployment of Docker container fixes
- Maintains compatibility with existing version checking mechanisms

Overall Benefits:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Provides better error reporting and debugging capabilities
- Eliminates intermittent failures in Docker container environments
- Enables reliable bbcp operation in modern containerized infrastructures

LICENSE COMPLIANCE:
==================
All changes are made under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPL v3)
as specified in src/COPYING.LESSER. The modifications enhance functionality
while maintaining full compliance with the original license terms.

DEPLOYMENT:
===========
The fixes are available in the bbcp source code with enhanced bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C
containing improved hostname resolution capabilities.

VALIDATION STATUS:
==================
✓ Code compiled successfully with all changes
✓ Hostname resolution verified working (bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C)
✓ File specification decode enhanced for Docker compatibility (bbcp_FileSpec.C)  
✓ Version number updated to 17.12.00.00.1 (bbcp_Version.C)
✓ Error handling improved across all modified components
✓ Debug logging functional for troubleshooting
✓ Memory management verified for all changes
✓ Backward compatibility maintained
✓ Docker container testing successful
✓ License compliance confirmed for all modifications

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
1. src/bbcp_NetAddrInfo.C - Enhanced hostname resolution with fallback mechanisms
2. src/bbcp_FileSpec.C - File specification decode fix for Docker container compatibility  
3. src/bbcp_Version.C - Version number updated from 17.12.00.00.0 to 17.12.00.00.1

SUMMARY:
========
This patch set addresses critical Docker container compatibility issues in bbcp by:
1. Fixing hostname resolution failures through enhanced fallback mechanisms
2. Resolving file specification decode errors when handling incomplete field sets
3. Updating the version number to clearly identify installations with these fixes

All changes maintain full backward compatibility while significantly improving bbcp's 
reliability in containerized environments.
